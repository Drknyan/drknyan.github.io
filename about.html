      <h1>Welcome To Yggdrasil</h1>

      <h2>Here you will learn the Lore of the World</h2>
      <br />
      <h4>The End and the Beginning</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the beginning, Yggdrasil was a world like any other, however this was
        destined to change when calamity struck nearly causing an apocolyptic
        event. The only way to prevent this was the System. This System is named
        Yggdrasil and was put in place at the core of the world to save it, so
        that those that inhabit it and those that come to inhabit it can all
        live and thrive. As the years became decades became centuries, the old
        civilization came to an end as the world came to a soft reset, the old
        buildings being buried or lost to the sands of time. The only remnant
        now is the Labyrinth, a planet wide dungeon. As elven life has gone on,
        they were joined by humans, dwarves, and other races that came to
        inhabit Yggdrasil.

      <h4>The Adinistrators</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Administrators are those that help keep the system in place and in
        check, because of this and their power they are rumoured by those who
        know of them to be god like entities or even the gods themselves.

      <h2>Locations</h2>
      <br />
      <h4>The Labyrinth</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Labyrinth, also known as the Great Dungeon, is a gigantic, world
        wide underground labyrinth of stone passageways leading deeper and
        deeper into the world. It has three parts known to those above, four to
        the Administrators; The Upper Stratum, The Middle Stratum, The Lower
        Stratum, and the Bottom Stratum. No adventurer has ever been deeper than
        the entrances to the Middle Stratum and lived to tell the tale, for some
        of the more monstrous races live in these caverns.<br /><br />
        The Upper Stratum is home to fairly weak monsters, not goblins and the
        like but spider monsters, snake monsters, and other beings suited for
        darkness.<br /><br />
        The Middle Stratum is a molten labyrinth of stone and lava passages,
        many fire wyrms are said to make their home here.<br /><br />
        The Lower Stratum is only known to the surface by history's stories, and
        is said to be home to the strongest of monsters; Full fledged dragons,
        greater spider monsters, even a rumoured queen spider monster.<br /><br />
        Only the Administrators know of the Bottom Stratum, the very core of the
        world and all that remains from the old world.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4>The Countryside of Jun</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Countryside of Jun is home to a number of forests, mountains, rivers
        and a swamp. Be wary though for the wilds are home to Goblins, Orcs,
        Ogres, and other such monstrous races. The farmland in the Countryside
        is tended by humans and are largly left alone by most monster races as
        they simply want to live in peace, as such humans, some elves, and the
        occasional dwarf are largely left to their territories by the monster
        races. Occasionally there will be raiding parties of monsters but that
        is far more rare than human bandits raiding villages. Deep in the forest
        there are even rumors of Dryads, keepers and protectors of the forest.
        The goblins and ogres are said to live in the forest, while the orcs
        live in the foothils to the Spine Mountains. There are rumors of an
        underground Lizardmen village in the Styx swamp.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4>The Kingdom of Raventalon</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The kingdom of Raventalon lies at the western edge of the forest of Jun,
        and is inhabited mostly by humans. The capital city of Raventalon is the
        city of Crowsong. Crowsong is ruled by the nobilty of the Einz family,
        currently lead by the human mage Lord Momen Einz. While Crowsong is
        tolerant of most races, monsters from the dungeon will be attacked on
        sight. The monsters of the forests are tolerated to trade with on
        occasion. The farmland surounding Crowsong is protected by wooden walls,
        while the city itself has stonebrick walls protecting it. Crowsong has
        four city gates, located on the cardinal directions for the town. The
        Green Dragon Inn is the most popular tavern and inn in Crowsong. The
        city does have a chapel for the Curch of Her Holy Word.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4>The Kingdom of Dwargaur</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Citystate of the Dwarves, Dwargaur is a cave city built into a
        mountain far from the forests, and is located at the edge of the Spine
        Mountains. It is approximately three weeks by foot from Dwargaur to
        Crowsong. This city is home to some of the finest cratsmen in the world,
        Meard Onyxia is one of these craftsmen. The King of Dwargaur, King
        Gimnam Giott, has declared Dwargaur a free trade city, meaning any
        sentient being can come to trade here, such as Shiori The Deathbloom
        Scythe spider monster. The Lotus Tavern and Inn is the best in Dwargaur
        and has little competition.
      </p>

        Greater Demon Lord, Drako Morgolen. The laws of the nation are said to
        be the simplest in the wolrd, while there are a few laws pertaining to
        daily life to protect the citizenry, the top law is simple: Survival of
        the Fittest. Drako Moroglen rules absolutely in this nation. The captial
        of Vrobirmir, Darking, is home to Morgolen Castle, and is a port city

        gates in total at the five compas points between West, South, and East.
        THe best inn in Darking is the Winter's Kiss Inn.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4>The Islands of the Mists</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        Rumored to be north of Vrobirmir is an island chain encompassed by mists
        and storms. Little is known about life on the island other than it might
        be possible to get there via the Labyrinth.
