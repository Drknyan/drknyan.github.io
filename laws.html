      <!-- Discord Server Rules-->
      <h2>Discord Server Rules</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        1.] No unpingable names/nicknames.<br />
        2.] No overly explicit nicknames and/or profile pictures, or anything
        else on your profile like your status or about me. <br />
        3.] Racism, Sexism, or any other form of discriminations will not be
        tolerated Out Of Character. Speciesism will be tolerated in character if
        there is reason, I.E: a human is interacting with a monster, within
        reason. Otherwise it will not be tolerated. <br />
        4.] Any harassment of any kind, including but not limited to death
        threats, DDoS threats, and sexual harassment will result in an immediate
        ban. <br />
        Do not advertise your Discord Servers, Youtube, Twitch, et cetera
        without permission from @Drako Vishious , If approved it will be put in
        a proper channel. <br />
        6.] This is a pg-13 server, meaning no nsfw stuff, romance in between
        characters is ok to a point. <br />
        7.] Respect the mods, if they tell you to stop doing something, then
        stop it. <br />
        8.] Keep IRL Religious, Political, and anything else subjective/can
        start an argument out of the server. <br />
        9.] Characters should be original characters, do NOT steal existing
        characters or use canon characters to anime/tv/movies. <br />
        10.] Once you've finished reading this go to the portal and say
        Reincarnated. <br />
        11.] The server's Primary language is English, if your username is not
        in English, make sure your nickname uses roman characters. Occasional
        messages in other languages will not get punished as long as you
        primarily use English. <br />
        11.] Enjoy yourself and please have fun, but do use common sense. <br />
        12.] As stated in Rule 6, there is no NSFW stuff between characters,
        however if it is reported that an underage user is trying to do nsfw
        stuff in DMs then they well be investigated and most likely banned. This
        is to keep those in this server safe. <br />
        13.] Rules on this server are subject to change as nessessary.

      <!-- Roleplay Rules -->
      <h2>Roleplay Rules</h2>
      <p>
        1.] The killing of other User's Characters is prohibited without that
        User's express permission. That said, the world is dangerous and you may
        lose a character to the world's roleplay if not careful. <br />
        2.] No “Godmodding”, “Auto-hitting”, “Bunnying”, “Metagaming”, or any
        other behaviors not normally accepted within roleplaying or combat
        roleplays. <br />
        2.A] Godmodding is an unfair use of your character's powers and similar
        actions or such things. <br />
        2.B] Auto hitting is the act of assuming an attack has instantly landed
        on an opponent without giving them a chance to react or avoid the
        attack. Be sure to avoid specific wordings in your post. Ex: "She
        punched him in the face" is not acceptable, but "She aimed a punch to
        land against his face" is. <br />
        2.C] "Bunnying" is the act of using multiple attacks in a singular post.
        While we are typically relaxed we ask that you keep things within
        reason. I.E: Casting multiple spells of magic at the same time that is
        not specified within any of the skill trees. The exceptions being
        similar to Mass Magic: Death Storm. <br />
        2.D] "Metagaming" is the act of having your character aware of
        information that they shouldn't be. For example, if you learn in the ooc
        chat someone has a weakness to fire, your character shouldn't just be
        able to know this I.C. <br />
        3.] Staff and the Words of the World Tupper are not bound by these
        previous rules if they are Game Mastering something. <br />
        4.] While NPCs exist we ask that you not go overboard using them. <br />
        4.A] Hostile NPCs should only be played by Staff in most situations.
        <br />
        5.] When role playing with groups of people, one may find that a
        particular person disappears, or is not able to post for quite some
        time. If your characters are NOT INVOLVED IN A COMBAT SCENARIO, you may
        simply have your character post out of turn to leave. If involved in
        combat, you must NOT assume attacks land, or leave a fight in progress
        because of a person's inability to post. If you feel locked, or in an
        unfair situation, contact a moderator, and exceptions will be made
        depending on the circumstance. <br />
        6.] Starting equipment must be simple and within reason of why the
        character would have it. <br />
        7.] Unique Skills are Unique and must be approved by Staff and Can not
        be used by other Characters. <br />

      <!-- Leveling Up Rules-->
      <h2>Leveling Up Rules</h2>
      <p>
        If you feel that your character has done enough to level up ask a @Staff
        member about leveling up and they will corrordinate how many levels your
        character's level or your character's skill's level grows.
