      <h2>Skill Rules</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Skills Level up with use to a maximum of ten levels, the next time it
        would achieve a level the skill will either unlock more skills, evolve
        into a new skill, or simply remain capped at tenth level. For example:
        Magic Trees can unlock more skills or evolve into new ones such as:
        Flame Magic evolves/unlocks to Fire Magic. Light Magic will Unlock
        Healing Magic, Holy Magic, Photomancy Magic, and Revitalization Magic.
        Some Magic Skills called Mass Magics can be unlocked after Gaining the
        required Skills. For Example Mass Magic: Death Storm Requires Tide
        Magic, Tempest Magic, and Thunder Magic to all have been acquired and
        leveled up to level 5. In addition, magics are more difficult to level
        and unlock higher tiers the stronger the magic tier is.
        <br />
        Spells must be approved by Staff and must be in a Magic Skill the
        Character has. Unique Skills exist and can be held, however once a
        character has acquired a Unique Skill, no other character can unlock it
        as long as the holder is alive.
        <br />
        Some skills can evolve into a Unique Skill, and from the Unique Skill to
        an Ultimate Skill which will also unlock a Title. For Example: Appraisal
        Level 10 will next evolve to Great Sage Level 1. Great Sage Level 10
        will Evolve to Wisdom and bestow the Title: Lord of Wisdom. Unique
        Skills are Harder to Level up than ordinary skills, For example: Great
        Sage will gain levels more difficulty than its predecessor Appraisal,
        however once it does reach level 10 it will evolve into the Ultimate
        Skill Wisdom. Once You gain an Ultimate Skill it's predecessor skill
        will be able to be gotten by another character, however like Unique
        Skills, Ultimate Skills can only be held by a single character. Some
        Skills can be acquired through activity, for example: Swordsmanship
        Level 1 is gained through swinging a sword for the first time. The Skill
        “Naming” can be acquired by anyone, however it requires the skill
        “Creature Taming” or “Animal Friend” to work the most efficiently.
        Naming an Animal, Creature, or Friendly Monster will cause it to evolve
        more quickly or immediately (Depends heavily on staff availability and
        approval of what the Animal, Creature, or Monster will evolve into.).
        This may also cause animals to evolve into familiars.
